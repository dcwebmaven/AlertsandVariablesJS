# AlertsandVariablesJS

Objective:
Consider the following code: 

<html>

<head>
<script type="text/javascript"> 
<!-- 

function seeIt(event){
  
  YOUR FIRST STATEMENT SHOULD GO HERE
  YOUR SECOND STATEMENT SHOULD GO HERE

}

//-->
</script>
</head>

<body onload="seeIt(event)">

<form>
  <input type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="seeIt(event)">
</form>

</body>
</html>	 


Right now this code is incomplete. It is your job to finish it. Here are the things you must do: 


In the first statement create a variable to represent event.type. Although you might not know what information event.typegives you, you should be able to determine this after completing the code.
In the second statement create an alert using the variable assigned above. 

You should include comments on your webpage giving a brief description of what happened. What information does event.typegive you?
